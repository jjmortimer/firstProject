<p>
  But wherefore do not you a mightier way <br>
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?<br>
And fortify yourself in your decay<br>
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?<br>
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,<br>
And many maiden gardens yet unset<br>
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,<br>
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:<br>
So should the lines of life that life repair,<br>
Which this, Time's pencil,<sup>[3]</sup> or my pupil pen,<br>
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,<br>
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.<br>
To give away yourself keeps yourself still,<br>
And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.<br>
